This is the sample iOS App to demonstrate Core ML with AVCapture on iOS 11- Xcode 9. 

## Prerequisite:
1. Install Xcode 9 (Beta for now)
2. update to iOS 11 on your iphone device (Beta for now)

## Execution: 
1. Build run the App in the device.
2. Tap on the camera preview to capture the Image and see the result below.


## Note: 
This project source is of large size , reason being that it includes two ml model files bunlded in the project.
It is intentionaly added so as to build preview the app quickly. Developers can remove the model and try adding
any new model from, https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/ 

Hence cloning would take some time.
